# minigame-1
## Devlog
I added 4 spikes and 2 coins to the game, and also moved 3 of the blocks to make the small high platform in the middle of the map look more complete. Additionally, 
I slightly increased the player's movement speed from 4 to 6, and to make the game more interesting, I raised the player's jump height to 5¡ªthis way, the player will feel really satisfying when jumping.
If a Scene is a house, then GameObjects are the rooms in the house (such as bedrooms and living rooms), and Components are the things in each room ¡ª like beds and table lamps in a bedroom, sofas and TVs in a living room. A room is useful only with these things, and it is these rooms with things that make up a complete house.
